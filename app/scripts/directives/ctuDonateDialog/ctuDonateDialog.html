        <p> Citytrip United is a nonprofit organisation started out of the love for travelling and front end development.
            I sincerely hope you enjoy visiting this place on the interwebs and that it can be of your advantage when travelling.
            As this pet project is born out of passion I do not ask for anything in return, but if you like you can sponsor
            me for any amount so I can keep on adding new trips and features to the site. Just click the button below to send some
            love to Citytrip United.
